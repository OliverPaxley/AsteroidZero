# NASA API Request Management Implementation

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive API request management across all three components (ImpactMapPage, Mission, FrameOne) to prevent exceeding the 1000 requests/hour NASA API limit.

## Key Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Request Deduplication
- **ImpactMapPage**: Added `ongoingRequests` Map to prevent multiple simultaneous requests for the same asteroid
- **FrameOne**: Added similar deduplication for asteroid detail fetches
- Prevents users from triggering duplicate API calls through rapid clicking

### 2. Local Caching
- **ImpactMapPage**: Implemented `detailsCache` to store fetched asteroid details
- **FrameOne**: Added similar caching mechanism
- Cached data is reused immediately without additional API calls
- Cache persists during component lifecycle

### 3. Proper useEffect Management
- **All Components**: Added proper dependency arrays `[]` to prevent re-fetching on every render
- **All Components**: Added cleanup functions with `mounted` flags to prevent memory leaks
- **Mission & ImpactMapPage**: Added `AbortController` for request cancellation on unmount

### 4. Loading State Management
- **ImpactMapPage**: Added `loadingDetails` state to track individual asteroid detail requests
- Prevents users from triggering multiple requests while one is in progress
- Buttons are disabled during loading

### 5. Batch Processing with Concurrency Control
- **All Components**: Maintained existing `CONCURRENCY = 4` limits for batch requests
- Prevents overwhelming the API with simultaneous requests
- Processes requests in controlled batches

### 6. NASA Service Built-in Protection
The NASA service (`src/services/nasa.js`) already includes:
- Request counter with 1000 request cap
- Request deduplication for identical URLs
- localStorage persistence for request counts
- Automatic error handling for 429 (rate limit) responses

### 7. Error Handling
- **All Components**: Proper error catching and logging
- Graceful fallbacks when API requests fail
- User feedback for loading and error states

## API Request Patterns

### Initial Load (per component):
1. **Mission**: 1 `fetchNeoFeed` + up to N `fetchNeoDetails` (batched)
2. **FrameOne**: 1 `fetchNeoFeed` + up to N `fetchNeoDetails` (batched)  
3. **ImpactMapPage**: 1 `fetchNeoFeed` + up to N `fetchNeoDetails` (batched)

### User Interactions:
- **ImpactMapPage**: Additional `fetchNeoDetails` calls only if not cached
- **FrameOne**: Additional `fetchNeoDetails` calls only if not cached and not in asteroid object
- **Mission**: No additional user-triggered API calls

## Rate Limit Protection
- Conservative approach: Components designed to work within NASA's limits
- Built-in request counting and deduplication in nasa.js service
- Batch processing prevents API flooding
- Caching eliminates redundant requests

## Benefits
1. **Reduced API Usage**: Caching and deduplication significantly reduce API calls
2. **Better UX**: Loading states and disabled buttons prevent confusion
3. **Reliability**: Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks and race conditions
4. **Performance**: Cached data loads instantly
5. **Resilience**: Error handling and fallbacks ensure app stability

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test rapid clicking on asteroid buttons in ImpactMapPage
2. Verify cache behavior by selecting same asteroids multiple times
3. Test component unmounting during API requests
4. Monitor browser network tab for duplicate requests
5. Test with NASA API rate limiting scenarios
